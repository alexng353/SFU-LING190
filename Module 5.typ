In this module, we'll be learning a bit about what _allows_ humans to produce
speech, despite how other closely related animals, like primates, cannot.

== Why Can't Primates Speak?

Primates are the closest living relatives of humans. Early on, human scientists
attempted to teach a chimpanzee how to speak, with very little success. The
animal was able to learn 7 words in 6 years, but it was unable to match the
speech ability of even a very young human child.

= Animals make sounds!
== Lecture Topics

- Many animals vocalize, in a variety of ways
- How have humans adapted our vocal tracts for speech?
  - Anatomy of the the vocal tract
  - Neural control over this anatomy
- How human anatomy and neural control, together, allow us to produce speech.

== Birds Make Sounds!

Birds also have a trachea, like humans do, but bird tracheae typically split
into two parts. Instead of a larynx, we say that birds have a syrinx. Some birds
produce sound only on one side of this mechanism, while other birds produce
sounds from both sides.

Some birds have whats known as a vocal organ, which allows them to produce some
kind of sound by perturbing the airflow on either one or both sides of the
syrinx.

== Toothed Whales (Dolphins) Also Make Sounds!

Another common way of vocalizing, utilized by toothed whales (including orcas
and dolphins) is to use their blowholes. They push air through their blowholes
and use a structure known as the *anterior and posterior bursa* to achieve the
same effect as how humans use the vocal folds.

Toothed whales, like dolphins, also have other parts of their head that change
the characteristics of their vocalizations. The "Melon" of a dolphin can be
tensed in certain ways to modulate the sound. Toothed whales can produce sounds
at human-audible frequencies for social communications. In addition to these
human-audible sounds, many toothed whales can produce sounds at very high
frequencies for echolocation.

== Apes (and many other mammals) Make Sounds!

We are particularly interested in how apes, and other mammales, make sounds, as
opposed to humans. 

- Just like humans, apes have a larynx, and basically all the other passive and
  active articulators that humans have, and can vocalize, but cannot speak.
- What is it that prevents them from being able to speak?
  - It's not just understanding concepts or the social significants of different
    types of communicative signs.

=== Historical Attempts to Teach Apes to Speak

- Early attempts to teach chimpanzees to speak (1930s to 1950s)
  - *Gua* (didn't learn to talk)
  - *Viki* (only learned 4 words)
- Early attempts to teach apes ASL (1960s to 1980s)
  - *Washoe* -- A chimp who produced and recognized hundreds of signs and sign
    combinations
  - *Koko* -- A gorilla who produced many, many signs and some sign combinations
  - *Nim Chimpsky* -- Named after Noam Chomsky, a chimp who produced and
    recognized over 100 signs and some sign combinations

We were never able to teach apes to speak, but we were able to teach them to
communicate with humans.

= How have humans adapted our vocal tracts for speech?

There are two theories on why apes cannot speak:
+ The Anatomical Theory
+ The Neuro-behavioral Theory

== When did we start to speak? (_phylogeny_)

*Phylogeny* -- The study of evolutionary time.

We want to look at the category of primates, which includes humans, great apes
(orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas), and in addition other species like
lemurs, and lorises.

The anatomy of other hominins is very unclear, as we have no record of soft
tissues in the vocal tract. However, we do know that some of these other species
have similar bone structures in the area surrounding the vocal tract.

== Anatomy of the the vocal tract

One idea is that what separates hominins from other hominids, is something about
the anatomy that allows hominins like humans to produce speech but prevents
other hominids like orangutans, or chimpanzees, from doing so. There are many of
the same anatomical structures, but the shapes and sizes of these structures is
all different.

+ One detail is that humans have a larynx that is very low, which makes the
  superlaryngeal vocal tract sound "larger."
  - Having a larger superlaryngeal vocal tract makes animals have a very low
    (deep) voice.
+ Humans can also control the tongue in 2 dimensions, whereas apes can only go
  front and back. Humans also have a large SLVT and can use it to produce more
  sounds.

=== But is this really a problem?

One way we can ask whether this anatomy really is a problem is to model the
vocal tract of a monkey using an x-ray machine. We can use this model to
simulate what would happen if the monkey could move its tongue in the same way a
human can.

By doing this kind of study, many researchers have suggested that anatomy is not
the problem. There is nothing, in theory, about the monkey vocal tract that
prevents it from producing speech-like sounds (if the monkey had complete
control over its tongue).

Conclusion: Anatomy is not the problem.

== Sophisticated Neuromuscular Control over the Tongue and Other Superlaryngeal Articulators

The second theory of why humans can speak, but other great apes cannot, is that
our brains have evolved to give us more sophisticated control over the muscles
in our vocal tract, so that we can imitate vocalizations for social reasons.
This change has specifically come about to allow us to produce speech.

Fitch (2000) makes some hypotheses:
+ Humans like to vocally imitate each other (just like parrots, seals, dolphins,
  etc.)
+ Being good at imitating the way someone speaks plays a social role (ability to
  identify in-group and out-group members)
+ Later became relevant for social communications

= How does human anatomy and neural control, together, allow us to produce speech?

+ How can we synthesize speech just by knowing the size and shape of a vocal
   tract?
+ Introduce some new acoustic concepts (*harmonics*, *resonance*)
+ Source-filter theory and *formants*

== How do we synthesize speech from a vocal tract?

First, we have to look at
+ Standing waves
+ Harmonics
+ Resonance
+ Source-filter theory

=== Waves and Harmonics

- Speech is often periodic, but it is never a "simple" waveform. 
- How do we think about more complex waveforms?
- We'll start with think about "sinusoidal" or "standing" waveforms.

==== Standing Waves
- When waves hit a boundary, they can be reflected back.
- With the movement of different waves, you can have a stable parttern (standing
  wave).

==== Complex Waves

==== Complex Waves

- It’s possible to “add together” multiple standing waves of certain frequencies
  to create a complex waveform.  
- Adding these waves together produces a stable (periodic) complex wave  
  - Also known as a *composite sinusoidal wave*  
- This is basically what most kinds of human speech (e.g. vowels) look like  

==== Harmonics

The standing waves that comprise our composite waveform are called *harmonics*.
In speech, each harmonic’s frequency is an integer multiple of the lowest
harmonic --- known as the fundamental frequency --- which corresponds to the
rate at which your vocal folds vibrate. For example, if the fundamental
frequency is 200 Hz, the second harmonic is 400 Hz, the third is 600 Hz, and so
on. This fundamental frequency, often referred to as pitch, determines whether a
voice sounds high or low. 

We can visualize multiple harmonics on a two-dimensional graph, where the x-axis
represents frequency in hertz and the y-axis represents the amplitude of each
harmonic component. Each harmonic on this graph would be equally spaced, since
they are all integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Someone with a
lower pitched voice would have harmonics that are closer together, while someone
with a higher pitched voice would have harmonics that are further apart. It so
happens that the lowest harmonics tend to be the loudest, and the highest
harmonics tend to be softer. 

=== Resonance and Source-Filter Theory

==== Resonance
Resonance is a property of a material. If a wave comes into contact with a
certain material or volume, and this material or volume has a certain *resonant
frequency* that matches this wave, it will resonate and the wave will be
amplified.

==== Source-Filter Theory

The vocal tract can be thought of as *two* different air chambers that,
ultimately, have different resonant properties (depending on how the tongue is
shaped). What happens when we have control over these two air chambers is that
we can amplify different harmonics that allow you to produce different vowel
sounds.

Vowels are primarily characterized by the first few harmonics which are
amplified by the two air chambers created by the tongue in the superlaryngeal
vocal tract.

Acoustically, what is happening is that the larynx is producing a source, with a
fundamental frequency and many harmonics, and the superlaryngeal vocal tract is
filtering this source, and choosing different harmonics to resonate. What is
produced is a complex waveform with different properties, and we can choose
which properties are desirable, etc. Note that sometimes the harmonics, ordered
from lowest to highest, may not have the same amplitude. It is even possible
that $H_1$ will have a smaller amplitude than $H_2$. However, there is always an
*overall* decrease in harmonic amplitudes.

What is to note, is that the specific harmonic that is amplified is not
important for producing the desired vowel. What is important is the _frequency_
of that harmonic. Therefore, regardless of the $F_0$ fundamental frequency of
the speaker's voice, the filter used is the same, and the output waveform will
look similar despite the density and location of the harmonics being different.
This introduces a new concept, which is the *formant*.

==== Formants

I.e. the frequenc(ies) of the harmonics that are amplified. 

Formants are the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The first three
formants, $F_1, F_2, F_3$, are the most important formants for speech sounds.
For different vowels, the values of these formants will be different.
