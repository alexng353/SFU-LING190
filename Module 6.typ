= The Development of Speech in Human Infants

- 2 months: coos and makes gurgling sounds
  - We can see that even 2-month-olds are vocalizing
  - This includes crying, which is a very loud vocalization
  - Most babies, at this age, begin to coo.
- 6 months: coos develop primarily with an open vocal tract, but at 6 months,
  the babies beginning to move their superlaryngeal vocal tract, making more
  rhythmic sounds that begin to sound like consonants
- 9 months: lots of different sounds, including 'bababa' and 'mamamama'
  - this is called the 'babbling phase,' which just includes a repeating
    consonant-vowel pattern
- 18 months: several single words, and the words they're saying resemble the
  language that they are learning
- 2 years: sentences with 2 to 4 words.
- 4 years: storytelling, essentially fluent speech

== Topics to cover

- development of vocal tract anatomy
- Kinds of speech babies hear and produce
  - testing developmental speech perception
  - baby speech production
    - How baby vocalizations change throughout age and how it improves
- How we perceive and change our speech in adulthood
  - puberty voice changes
  - What are some of the factors that affect speech patterns and speech habits
    (which determine how we sound when we speak)

= Anatomy
- How do infant and child vocal tracts develop
  - length of vocal tract, vocal folds, other structures
  - Sex differences between males and females
  - What are some factors that affect how the vocal tract develops

== The newborn vocal tract

Very similar in shape to the ape vocal tract. Certain sounds are impossible or
very difficult to produce at this age, since the vocal tract is physically 
different to an adult.

#image("newborn vocal tract.png")

Some differences:
- No teeth in young babies
  - No teeth means no *dental* place of articulation
- Vocal tract length is much shorter
  - This will change later in development
  - Similar to apes, where the tongue can move forward and backward easily, but
    moving up and down is a problem.
- Newborns/young infants have less neuromuscular control over tongue and other
  active articulators
- The epiglottis is oriented differently than in an adult
- The vocal folds are also at an angle
- Larynx is still relatively high in the vocal tract

=== Childhood
- In the first 18 months of life, the vocal tract lengthens extremely
  quickly, which tracks with the development of the rest of the body at this
  age.
  - The vocal tract continues to lengthen into adulthood, but this slows down as
    is typical for the rest of the body.
  - It still takes many years for the vocal tract to reach its full length
  - In the first few years, there aren't many differences between the length of
    a male and female vocal tract, but as age increases, adult male vocal tracts
    are typically much longer than female vocal tracts.


=== Puberty
- Puberty is a gradual change (5-6 year duration)
- Usually begins at 9-11 years of age
  - starts slightly earlier in females
- There are dramatic changes in vocal tract during this period
- *Vocal tract length* increases
  - During puberty, the larynx descends rapidly.
  - By the end of puberty, the larynx ends up twice as long as it was before puberty
- *Males, on average* have a longer vocal tract (during and after puberty).
- There is still quite a bit of overlap (in percentiles) between male and female
  vocal tract lengths.
- *Length of vocal folds* also change
  - Before puberty, the vocal folds are very similar between males and females
  - After puberty, male vocal folds thicken and become longer compared to female
    vocal folds
  - Because of the changes in length and thickness, an audible drop in $F_0$
    pitch of male voices is noticeable (from an average of 280Hz to 120Hz).
    - Despite the average being around 120Hz, there is still quite a bit of
      variability.
    - Females, on average, have a pitch of around 220Hz

= Baby Speech Perception

== Methods to test infant speech perception

- *How* can you tell what a baby hears?

=== Fetal Heart Rate

Measuring changes in heart rate as a function of what is played through the
belly of the mother. We know that after about 26-28 weeks of gestation, the
fetal auditory system is relatively well developed, so during the third
trimester, we can begin to observe behavioral changes in the infant.

- Heart rate can be measured from ultrasound (among other methods)
- Fetal heart rate is functional by 28 weeks of gestation
- Can play a recording of
  - The Mother's voice
  - Another female voice that is not the mother's
  - We want to see if the baby can recognize the differences in qualities
    between the mother's voice and another woman's voice
- It is observed that the fetal heart rate increases when the baby hears the
  mother's voice, but decreases when the baby hears another woman's voice
  - Interestingly, the heart rate decreases when the baby is introduced to new
    stimuli.
  - It is theorized that the fetus's heart rate decreases when the baby is
    concentrating or thinking about something.

=== Habituation Method

When a baby is a little bit older, after it is born, we can use the habituation
method. Shown to work on newborns, and infants up to about 6 months old.

- We use a pacifier hooked up to a measuring device.
- We play a sound to the baby, and measure how many "hard" sucks the baby makes
  on the pacifier.
- We play a sound over and over again, until the baby gets bored
  - At some point, their response rate will drop
- At this point, we switch the sound.
  - If their response rate goes back up, the baby recognizes this as a new
    sound.
  
What's interesting is that even newborns with only a few hours of experience
with "full spectrum" speech can recognize the difference between similar
consonant sounds: /b/ vs /p/ for example.

Habituation also works on Japanese Quail and Chinchilla babies. This suggests
that many linguistically important distinctions (/pa/ vs /ba/ for example) may
be universally distinguished across many animal species. However, this is not
the case for *every* language sound. We know this because even for adult
speakers, there are many sounds that exist in other languages that are not
easily distinguished without language experience.

The fact that infants have no difficulty distinguishing between many sounds that
adults cannot distinguish is a strong indicator that, as a baby moves from a
"language-general" to "language-specific" stage, the infant's ability to
distinguish sounds decreases.

=== Conditioned Head-Turn

We train babies to turn their heads in response to certain sounds and reward
them by giving them visual stimulus.

= Baby Speech Production

- Children's speech production
  - Overview of speech production at different ages
  - What do children produce well/poorly?

== Cries at Birth
- Even at birth, vocalizations are influenced by language environment
  - There was a study that looked at the differences in the vocalizations of
    French babies and German babies. French intonation patterns have a more
    iambic (rising final syllable) quality, while German intonation patterns
    have a trochaic (falling final syllable) quality.
  - The key question is whether or not hearing these patterns in the womb would
    influence the production and quality of crying in newborn infants.
  - When we look at a typical french cry, we see a rise towards the end of the
    cry, with the opposite pattern in German.

=== Common Errors Children Make

- Why do children make these errors?
- In general, children make these mistakes because they are avoiding more
  difficult sounds.
  - Sometimes, they drop sounds that are hard to articulate
  - Sometimes they add sounds to make a word easier to say
  - Sometimes they substitute sounds (swapping manner or voicing)

= How we perceive and change our speech in adulthood

- What makes you sound like you?
  - @organic-influences --- Oculomotor Influences
  - @learned-influences --- Learned Influences

== Organic Influences <organic-influences>

- Height, weight, and other physical characteristics are not necessarily
  indicative of voice.
- Voice is determined by:
  - Length and mass of Vocal Folds
  - Length and shape of SLVT
  - Nature of soft tissues
- *On average, by sex and age:*
  - Men have longer SVLTs and VFs than women
  - Older speakers have slightly larger SLVTs and thinner VFs than younger
    speakers.
  - Older women's voices tend to get lower with age
    - due to hormonal changes

== Learned Influences <learned-influences>

How you sound is also determined by:
- Long-term configurations of the vocal tract
  - Larynx (source)
  - SLVT (filter)
- Consider these as *habits* of your vocal tract
  - You may hold your larynx or tense your vocal folds in certain ways that
    contribute to your voice quality.
  - You can move your SLVT in certain ways (dialetc, certain ways of speaking)
    that affects your accent, etc.

== Voice Quality

- Holding your larynx in certain ways can affect the length of your SLVT, which
  affects filter.
- Holding your vocal folds in certain ways can affect breathiness/creakiness.
